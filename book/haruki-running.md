title: What I Talk About When I Talk About Running

A calm and thoughtfully written memoir. Reading this feels like listening to Murakami's thoughts - his thinking before, during and after runs. The runs are described vividly and in gruesome detail which is why I ate those sections up.

Starting off, he sounds like one of those people that just sets his mind to a thing and does it - one of those overachieving super-talented people who breeze through life - but as the book goes on we get a glimpse behind the curtain and see the type of thinking required of a regular marathon runner and that it's in fact perseverance and persistence alone.

He shares his opinions on life and lifestyle and is fully conscious of the type of person he is. Something very valuable, I find, as I'm never 100% sure about the type of person I am. Reading his reactions and thoughts on muscle cramps and pain in general made me wonder if pushing through pain is something I as an occasional jogger should try.

He talked about talent and how he believes that talent is a finite resource for most. (This prompted more than one conversation with my girlfriend which is always a sign of a good book.) He talked about a state of mind one enters after running for more than 60 miles. He talked about running in the scorching heat of Greece on the actual Marathon field. He talked about a lot of interesting things that happened to him in life and draws some conclusions.

An excellent, calming, read that almost feels like a conversation with the author and it definitely inspired me to give running another try. Warmly recommended.
