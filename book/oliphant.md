title: Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine
---

In my head, Raymond is Roy from IT Crowd.
This picture has been firmly fixed in my head since his first appeareance.

Eleanor is tall.
She stands tall.
I've imagined her similarly to how they portray serious admin ladies in Hollywood sometimes: attractive, upright, well-spoken, wearing her hair in a ponytail.
Even though I know she has a burn scar, for whatever reason I imagined her having a line where a slice scar would be.
Also not sure why she had a ponytail in my brain image since it's pointed out in the book she hides her scar with her hair.

Eleanor is great.
On more than one occasion she made me snort, giggle, and at times laugh out loud.
I could relate to her situation.
There was a time in life I've felt that amount of loneliness and it is truly horrible.
There are few fears bigger than ending up alone.

Her transformation is one paved with kindness and help of others and if there's one takeaway from this book it would be that helping others and receiving help from others is something we should be more open to.

I absolutely love how her friendship with Raymond came to be.
At first it sounded a bit british (dunno why?), the way Raymond befriended her but then it struck me what was odd: I've never really just met somebody and decided let's be friends and became friends.
It was always somebody who was a school friend, a friend of a friend, and so on.
Acquaintances were made in some sort of setting where a shared person introduced me to another person.
To meet a random stranger on the street and become their friend through helping them feels like an old idea but not one that I'd expect to happen in my life.
As Eleanor learned, life is indeed full of surprises.

I'll definitely reread this book at some point.
To extract the funny bits, if nothing else.
