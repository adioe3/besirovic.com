It was the second day of July and I had just had a tasty burger and finished the blueberry muffin.

I was at work and it was a regular miserable day just like any other.
The workplace colleagues were in low spirits as usual and sometimes the food was our only happy refuge.

My stomach has been giving me problems on and off, small and large, consistently since about 2013 or 2015 so it was no surprise that I had to use the toilet shortly after.
After having done the deed and cleaned myself up, I started going back to the room when I felt a very sudden spike in my heart rate.

The room started spinning, I staggered down onto all fours and, crawling into the office, asked a colleague to call an ambulance.
My heart was racing faster and faster and it did not seem to slow down.
My forehead was shooting ice-cold bullets of sweat.
There was an intense sense of fear running up and down my spine.
Every single neuron seemed to have been triggering: all I could focus on was breathing.

Something was horribly, horribly, *horribly* wrong and I knew it but couldn't communicate it.
I tried to spout out a full sentence but all I could do was breathe, or, more precisely, hyperventilate.

Thirty one is a bit early for a heart attack, no?

I thought so too.
The funny bit was that after all the EKGs, stress tests, measurements, blood panels, etc, every test came back normal.
Every. Single. Test.
There was nothing wrong it would seem and yet, I *knew* there was something *horribly horribly* wrong.

My blood pressure was 160 over 90 -- I could not stand up and walk without assistance.
My hamstrings felt like hooks attached to shaky vibrating springs.
I got dizzy from any sudden movement.
My entire field of view seemed to be shrinking.
Looking at myself in the mirror *literally* looked like tunnel vision:
I see my hands washing my face but it all looks like watching a video game.
It was at this time that I also experienced my first night terror -- woke up in a pool of sweat.
I quickly became regular at my GP's until after the fifth-or-so visit.

It's not every day you see your GP hold his head in desperation while muttering "what should I do" to himself.

Everybody rises to their level of incompetence.
Lucky for me, a visiting GP had a hunch.
She ordered a barrage of tests which pointed to something tangible.
Something that ultimately explained what happened to me.

Me, a pack-a-week-smoking, beer-every-other-day, sweets-for-breakfast-pizza-for-lunch, severely depressed office worker with no romantic nor any other kind of healthy relationships in his life.
What happened sounded startlingly simple:

I had a panic attack.

All of the aftershock was side effects of the stress I was under.
Blood pressure, vision problems, breathing problems, digestive problems, sleeping problems, muscle problems, tendon problems, list goes on.
It took four visits to the emergency room across 6 months, each it's own level of horror, to arrive at that diagnosis.
That is four times where I was sure death is around the corner.
Aside the obvious fact you drop dead or unconscious, there is little difference between a panic and a heart attack with regards to symptoms.

I had resigned from life as I knew it -- It was at an end and would never be the same.

And it wasn't.

It is surprising how malleable the human brain really is: if you allow a thought to creep in, *lean into it*, let it anchor itself with a strong enough sensation or emotion, it can stick and start causing problems.
I was always a bit cynical and spewed defeatist attitudes (after all, I work in IT and know how horrible everything is, right?) but it was always an obvious fa√ßade -- I wasn't a nihilist.
More of a comical realist.

And then all this happened and I woke up one day firmly believing, nay, dreading that life made no sense anymore.
A dangerous idea.
All we were raised to aspire to was being proven wrong and even inhumane.
Aspiring to be a CEO in a system that destroys the planet you live on makes little sense.
It does not help that all the role models for the position are shooting themselves into space in metal dicks instead of solving world hunger.
Toss a Trump, a Boris Johnson, your Witcher, and a pandemic into the fire too because, why not?
China is running slave camps and most of our rented apartments still have "Made in China" all over them.

So I went nuclear.

I torpedoed the stressors out of my life: quit the janky job, quit smoking (who knew trauma was a method?), quit drinking instantly, quit coffee and resigned to leave the city I was sure I'd be buried in alongside my friends.
Literally took all components of life as I knew it for the past decade and abandoned them.
Started out fresh in another city, closer to family.

It took a year of medication to stabilize.

Anti-depressants are basically voodoo mojo hackysacks and nobody knows how they work.
They *might* make you suicidal (even if you weren't before).
They *might* give you erectile disfunction.
Hell, from reading the label, they might do everything but make you bleed out of your ass although I'm sure there's an SSRI somewhere out there that can do that as well.
They're also an onboard/offboard medication: there's a 4-week (up to 2-months) period of adjusting to them.
After you're stable you gotta taper off, usually with a longer period than the onboarding.
Not fun. **Not fun at all**.

Once the meds worked, therapy started.

Once a week, talk to a dude until you figure out what happened.
After being stable for a while taper off the meds but keep talking to the dude.
You will not necessarily *feel* better from talking to the dude but saying some things out loud makes them less scary.
And the dude will be able to make connections not you nor anyone you know can.
This is because you will **never** be fully honest with anyone in your life as much as with this complete stranger.
Annoyingly, the quality that makes him good at his job is also a quality that makes him annoying: he does not care about *you*.
Not the *individual* you at least.
He cares about solving your problem.
So you sit together and work the problem until you've made some connections.
Some will be lesser, some will be greater, but there'll always be connections.
It's team sports.
It takes a while too and you won't even notice the improvement.
In the same way you don't notice nails growing until they're overgrown and need attention.
Gradual improvement takes time.

There are techniques, methods, and practices that can help you greatly to stay calm and safe and you should learn them.
You should sit down, away from it all for a minute and reflect on things.
Reflect on how you sit on a chair -- it matters more than you know.
Reflect on how much sunlight you get in a day -- it matters more than you know.
Reflect on what really matters to you.
If you don't know that's okay!
Spend the time to find out.
Pay attention to things in your life before they become problems because no stress will ever be worth your mental health, no matter the payoff.
As someone who was suckered young into working overtime and working weekends for a bit of extra pay and vacation and had plenty of burnout, I can confirm.

If you have similar issues, are under constant stress, or are depressed, talk to your friends and family but far more importantly, talk to a specialist.
Because your friends care about you but that dude cares about solving your problem.

I know this because I went through this.

Before all this, on the outside I looked a happy lad but on the inside my life was being miserable and depressed and a ball of stress just waiting to have a meltdown.
Nobody noticed, nobody knew, or, worst of all, nobody cared.

Today however, every morning I wake up and every night I go to bed with a token of love from my girlfriend.
I have a job I like, working with people I like.
I live in a city that welcomes me, with all my faults and issues.
I'm trying to lose weight so I can do more sports.
I still struggle with where I want to be in life and it changes with the weather and that's okay.
Life is still a confusing, bumbling, mumbling ball of uncertainty, health problems, and crises but I am far better equipped to deal with it and even manage to squeeze some happiness out of it.
Take care of yourself and you will too.

Best of luck.
